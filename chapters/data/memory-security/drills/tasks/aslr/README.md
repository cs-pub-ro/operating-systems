# ASLR

Navigate to `chapters/data/memory-security/drills/tasks/aslr` and run `make skels` to generate the `support/` folder.
Then navigate to `support/src`.

Use the `Makefile.aslr` file to compile the `chapters/data/memory-security/drills/tasks/aslr/support/aslr.c` file:

```console
student@os:~/.../drills/tasks/aslr/support/$ make -f Makefile.aslr
```

By default, ASLR and PIC are enabled.
Observe the results.
Next, we disable ASLR:

```console
student@os:~/.../drills/tasks/aslr/support/$ echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

Even though the code is compiled with PIC, both library and user functions have the same address between runs.
Re-enable ASLR:

```console
student@os:~/.../drills/tasks/aslr/support/$ echo 2 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
```

Disable PIC by uncommenting the `-fno-PIC` and `LDFLAGS` lines.

We observe that for randomization to work, we need to instruct the OS to randomize the program sections and the compiler to generate code that is position independent.

## Checker

To run the checker, go into the `tests` directory located in `src`, then type `make check`.
A successful output of the checker should look like this :

```console
student@os:~/.../drills/tasks/aslr/support/src/tests make check
test_aslr                        ........................ passed ... 100

========================================================================

Total:                                                           100/100
```
