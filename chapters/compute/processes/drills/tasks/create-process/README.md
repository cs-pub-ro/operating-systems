# Create Process

Enter the `create-process/support/` folder and go through the practice items below.

1. Change the return value of the child process so that the value displayed by the parent is changed.

1. Create a child process of the newly created child.

Use a similar logic and a similar set of prints to those in the support code.
Take a look at the printed PIDs.
Make sure the PPID of the "grandchild" is the PID of the child, whose PPID is, in turn, the PID of the parent.
