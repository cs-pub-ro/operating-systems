# Guide: Memory Actions (and Leaks) in Existing Programs

We can use Valgrind to investigate existing programs in the system.
This tells us whether they possess memory leaks:

```

We can see that `ls` and `ps` don't have memory leaks.
However, the shell (Bash) shows a memory leak of 12 bytes (on the test system).
This may be a false positive or the subject of an actual investigation.

Note that the `still reachable` section of the output refers to memory that wasn't freed, but still has pointers referring to it.
A true memory leak occurs when no pointers refer any memory area.

## Practice

1. Investigate 2-3 other executables in the system using Valgrind.

1. Use `ltrace` to list `malloc()` and `free()` calls made by the investigated system executables.

Note that, as explained in the [Software Stack lab](https://open-education-hub.github.io/operating-systems/Lab/Software%20Stack/libcall-syscall), on some systems, `ltrace` does not accurately show the output, due to _now binding_.
Fear not, you can always check the library calls with a more verbose and harder to parse `ltrace` command:

```console
student@os:~$ ltrace -x "*"
```
