# Assignments

The assignments are a way to test your understanding of the course material.
Each assignment is a small project that encompasses the concepts you have learned in the labs.

Each assignment compreises of:

- a description of the assignment in the `README.md` file
- a `src/` directory that contains the code skeleton for the assignment
- a `tests/` directory that contains the test cases for the assignment
- optionally a `utils/` directory that contains utility functions that should not be changed

You can find the assignments in the `assignments` directory.

## Building and Testing the Assignments

Each assignment has its own Makefile to automate the building and testing process.
For more details on how to use it, check the `README.md` file in the assignment directory.
